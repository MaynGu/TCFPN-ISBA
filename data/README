For experimenting on the Breakfast Dataset, you can get it from http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/breakfast-actions-dataset/

The data used in the code is Frame-based precomputed reduced FV (64 dim): breakfast_data.tar.gz (~1GB) and Coarse segmentation information: segmentation_coarse.tar.gz

After downloading the data, please extract them here. The structure should look like:
data (or custom dir)/
    + breakfast_data/
        + s1/
            + cereals/
            + ...
    + segmentation_coarse/
        + cereals/
        + ...

You may also change the root directory 'data', which involves changing 'data_dir' in the code. However, the structure should remain the same.
