## Temporal Convolutional Feature Pyramid Network (TCFPN) &amp; Iterative Soft Boundary Assignment (ISBA)

---

### Introduction

In this work, we address the task of weakly-supervised human action segmentation in long, untrimmed videos. We propose a novel action modeling framework, which consists of a new temporal convolutional network, named Temporal Convolutional Feature Pyramid Network (TCFPN), for predicting frame-wise action labels, and a novel training strategy for weakly-supervised sequence modeling, named Iterative Soft Boundary Assignment (ISBA), to align action sequences and update the network in an iterative fashion. Details can be found in **[Weakly-Supervised Action Segmentation with Iterative Soft Boundary Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10699) (Li Ding & Chenliang Xu, CVPR '18)**

This repo includes Keras + Tensorflow implementation on [Breakfast](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/breakfast-actions-dataset/) dataset. Tested with Ubuntu 16.04 + Python 2.7.
